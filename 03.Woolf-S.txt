Sunday Dearest, You can't think how I loved your letter.
But I feel I have gone too far this time to come back again.
I am certain now that I am going mad again.
It is just as it was the first time, I am always hearing voices, and I shan't get over it now.
All I want to say is that Leonard has been so astonishingly good, every day, always; I can't imagine that anyone could have done more for me than he has.
We have been perfectly happy until these last few weeks, when this horror began.
Will you assure him of this?
I feel he has so much to do that he will go on, better without me, and you will help him.
I can hardly think clearly anymore.
If I could I would tell you what you and the children have meant to me.
I think you know.
I have fought against it, but I can't any longer.
Virginia.
