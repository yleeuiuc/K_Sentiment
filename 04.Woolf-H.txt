Tuesday Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again.
I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times.
And I shan't recover this time.
I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate.
So I am doing what seems the best thing to do.
You have given me the greatest possible happiness.
You have been in every way all that anyone could be.
I don't think two people could have been happier 'till this terrible disease came.
I can't fight any longer.
I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work.
And you will I know.
You see I can't even write this properly.
I can't read.
What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you.
You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good.
I want to say that?
everybody knows it.
If anybody could have saved me it would have been you.
Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness.
I can't go on spoiling your life any longer.
I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been.
V.
