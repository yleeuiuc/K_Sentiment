I am in debt to so many people.
I have caused too great a burden to be placed upon them.
I can't begin to fathom the countless agonies down the road.
The rest of my life would only be a burden for others.
I am unable to do anything because of poor health.
I can't read, I can't write.
Do not be too sad.
Isn't life and death all a part of nature?
Do not be sorry.
Do not feel resentment toward anyone.
It is fate.
Cremate me.
And leave only a small tombstone near home.
I've thought on this for a long time.
